# Simple multi stopwatch
This simple stopwatch allows users to add multiple stopwatches, each with its own name, and provides controls to start, pause, reset, and delete each stopwatch. The app ensures that stopwatch timers continue running even if the window is closed, using local storage. Additionally, users can export and import stopwatch data as JSON files, making it easy to transfer data between devices.
